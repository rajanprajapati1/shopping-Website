# Getting Started with Create React App and Vite

This project combines the power of Create React App and Vite for a seamless development experience.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a powerful tool that sets up a new React project with sensible defaults and a robust development environment.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the documentation on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production, optimized for performance, and ready to be deployed.

- `npm run eject`: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back. It allows you full control over configuration files, but at the cost of losing Create React App's conveniences.

## Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and more efficient development experience for modern web projects. It offers an incredibly fast dev server, instant server start, and a seamless integration with React.

### Why Use Vite with Create React App?

By combining the capabilities of Create React App and Vite, you get the best of both worlds. Create React App provides a solid base with easy-to-use scripts, while Vite offers enhanced performance and an intuitive development server.
